#Liaison Coding Challenge!

![Screen Shot](../master/css/img/screenshot.png "An exact replica!")

##Objective:
Complete the coding challenge in 3 hours.

1.  Application successfully connects to github API and can be run locally.

2.  User is able to input a search term that returns no more than 10 users matching the search query

3.  User is "rick-rolled" if search term includes the consecutive character string 'ron' (i.e. 'Bronson' will trigger the "rick-roll")

##Extra Sparkles (as Joe calls it):

1.  Scroll bar for results

2.  Input Validation

3.  A directive for the user cards

4.  A service to handle the calls to Github's API and return the data collected

##Biggest Challenge:
Learning to call app.js last!  I had no idea that could affect the flow and at the 11th hour I decided to create a service for retrieving the users and almost scrapped all the work until I started playing with the order of my script tags.

###Try it yourself!

In your Terminal you should - 

Enter the project folder:

`cd liaison`

Run this command to install all dependencies:

`npm install`

Run this command to run the application on localhost:3000:

`node server`

In your browser window navigate to localhost:3000.  Have fun!
